# Whitebox_Approach_for-Manufacturing_Process_Optimization
Github Repository of Paper Titled - "A Whitebox Approach for Prediction and Optimization of Manufacturing Processes using an Ensemble of Decision Trees, SHAP and Metaheuristic Optimizers" submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing

1.) The folder Dataset contains the normalized dataset, derived from the paper, in excel sheets. This has to be input to MATLAB for building models.

2.) The trained models are present in the trained_Decision_Tree_Ensemble_models folder. Please use them for reproducibility.

3.) MATLAB Code to generate various images are present in the MATLAB Code and Functions folder.
